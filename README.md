## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a design-oriented developer and wordsmith working on projects that interest me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m helping spiff up [DDEV](https://github.com/drud/ddev)â€™s documentation and website.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to play with [Astro](https://astro.build) and reading about [Highly Sensitive People](https://www.amazon.com/Highly-Sensitive-Person-Thrive-Overwhelms/dp/0553062182) because I could be their poster child.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on intentionally-loved details that makes peoplesâ€™ lives better. Probably internet-related.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at m@ttste.in, or say hi on [Mastodon](https://t00t.cloud/@mattrambles).
